# Pokémon TCG CLI Edition
**Version 1.0.0** 

This is a recreation of the Pokémon card game (tcg) for the command line! The code within this github repository was developed over the course of 1 week (from the 12/01/2021 - 19/01/2021). This project is being developed using Python 3.8.6 with utlization of the Socket library to facilitate network communication. This project was written in an interpreted manner, without the use of Classes - most functionalty is implemented by updating values in dictionaries and sending data back and fourth between users. This is my first "big project" so don't be too harsh. I have decided to call it quits for now as I must continue work on my dissertation, but I hope to return to this in May (after I graduate). Feel free to email me if you would like to help out or fix my spaghetti code! 

PS. I forgot to mention that this was designed with the use of a raspberry pi as the server. You need 2 computers with unique IP addresses to play or you can change to IP of the server.py file to be 127.0.0.1 if you would like to play alone against yourself.

## This was intended as a passion project. Clearly the rights for using the name Pokémon and the individual card names are owned by Nintendo ##
